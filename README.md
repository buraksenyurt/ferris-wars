# Ferris Wars

A game which is developing with [Zig programming](https://ziglang.org/) language and [Raylib](https://github.com/raylib-zig/raylib-zig/tree/devel) bindings for Zig.

The main purpose of this game is to learn Zig programming language while having fun. The game is inspired by classic arcade games and aims to provide an engaging experience with simple mechanics. You can read more about the game design in the [Game Design Document](gdd/README.md).

## Running the Game

First of all you need to have Zig installed on your machine. I am using Zig version `0.15.1` for development. You can download it from the [official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/)s. After installing Zig, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
zig build run
```
